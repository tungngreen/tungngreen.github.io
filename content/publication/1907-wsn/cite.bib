	abstract = {TDMA protocols can provide a reliable, collision-free data-transferring mechanism for wireless sensor networks. However, it requires an effective scheduling (time slot assignment)algorithm, which is a challenging issue, especially in wireless multi-hop networks due to random-based competition. In this paper, we propose DSTO, a distributed TDMA scheduling algorithm using Topological Ordering (TO). DSTO aims to reduce conflict of scheduling time among neighbor nodes by creating a Topological Order with local neighborhood size as the main priority factor. We implemented DSTO on OPNET Network Simulator and proved its effectiveness compared to DRAND in terms of running time and message overheads.},
