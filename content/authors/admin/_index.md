#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

 I am a Ph.D. student at [Collaborative Distributed Systems & Networks (CDSN) Lab](http://cds.kaist.ac.kr/), [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) under the advisorship of Prof. Dongman Lee. Previously, I was awarded the Korean Government Scholarship (KGSP) to pursue my Master’s degree in Information Engineering at Chungbuk National University, where I was advised by Prof. Taehong Kim.

My research focuses on the design and development of computing systems, particularly at the edge of the network. I am especially interested in areas such as edge AI and on-device AI, where inference and training can be performed on tiny, resource-constrained devices. I believe, in the future, these systems will become the backbone of a wide range of applications, including video analytics, IoT sensing, and smart mobility.

In my free time, I enjoy staying active. Whether it’s running, hiking, playing football, or practicing calisthenics, I can never get enough of it.
